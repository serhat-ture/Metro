The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

This system is very much easy and is user-friendly. The system gives gives to passenger four chooses.
1- Show card balance
2- Add money to card
3- Take the subway
4- Log out

The passenger can see balance, add money and take a ticket.
